Website

Service

The company I had an internship with over the summer, and still partly work for, have a base website that they want redesigned and new webpages built for. The company works in scientific research and design and provides a microscope service to customers that produces very large datasets, therefore I will need to design a user account system and login portal to build into the website. This will require a dashboard as well to access their service, and a presentable interface for it to run in. Of course, since we are now storing user information, I will need to learn more about security and implement practices to store this data, as well as security for the web server and file storage where the datasets will be managed from. This is the most basic form of the product I want to settle for, and if it proves to be too easy, there are other optional features I can start to work on such as further development to the app they offer as their service (labeling/tagging system on the microscope sample datasets) or a machine learning algorithm to recognize specimen on the samples.
